The Rat Royale oversees all pirate activity from his master ship, making sure everyone pays in their share and punishing the non-conformists with his hammer.\nTo keep the rust away, he hunts offchance traders and practises his wrestling skills on captives.\nAs archaic as their methods may seem, the Steel Rats embrace the easy ways, avoiding commercial trickery or scientific research: they fetch their metals off asteroids, processing ores at their own basic but efficient mobile factories designed for colony needs decades ago. They prefer quantity over quality; not interested in deep drilling or, say, deposits that require thourough chemical purification. Just taking it large and easy, you know. ",

Acts of sabotage at orbital factories; mass procurement for the sake of predatory pricing; damaging quality deposits of valuable elements used for polymer production; in the stellar age, all these, and many more, are a crime.

Their fervent dedication to the common cause is all that's left on the surface.\nReportedly, the Dominion's top management, including Coordinators, trades antimatter under the counter as a hobby rather than as the main source of income. (But then, even rogue agents from the clan's pirates couldn't quite confirm that.) No one still knows for sure the ultimate reason behind the Dominion's mass production of antimatter.

The shuttle runs on very special fuel, too, with management allocating each expedition member a certain quota. However, if you really need more, you can order extra.",

		"wormhole_howto_description_4": "Mineral deposits, polymers, technology... The pirate riches are spectacular. Yet there's another plot twist apart from radiation: destabilized fuel cells. If we stumble upon a container with a leaking energy block, we must either deactivate it or make a run for it; asap, in both cases. Too late—and the shuttle is compromised, in which case it'd be best to dump the hold and dash. The greater the mass, the longer it takes to gain momentum for the space-jump, that's why we'll only be saving the engine and the control unit.",
		"wormhole_howto_description_5": "The closer we get to the center of the battle, the more valuable our loot is: after all, that's where the leaders' bases, assembly lines and labs used to sit.

		"egypt_thoth_follower_info": "You’d not recognize Thoth’s apprentice in Ankheti easily; while her wise mentor advocates peaceful ways, she tends to act quickly and abruptly. They do share the same vision, though, upholding constant progress of civilization—since egoism and regress can only bring demise. ",
		"egypt_bast_info": "Bastet will sometimes tell the other unlettered folks that her cat is her former aide, locked in this body forever as punishment. For real, however, the cat is no less than the central (and crucial) unit in her spaceship’s navigation system.",
		"egypt_scarab_info": "It's a common belief that Scarabs have no personality. How misguided! While they’ve got no need for personal names and rely heavily on hive intelligence, they still harbor individual self-conscience. Kemet, their homeland, hates philosophical zombies in general and Coordinators in particular.",
		"egypt_anubis_info": "Anubis endorses human curiosity, and he’s always happy to share the knowledge acquired over the centuries. Millions listen to his lectures, with thousands attending personally. However, he cannot figure out why so many would greedily latch onto his every word yet fail to memorize the truly important ones…",
		"egypt_sobek_info": "Sobek’s predatory looks and his habit of stepping in his tracks abruptly used to frighten colonists at first. And, when he’d jump start randomly to check the hold or dive into the lock chamber, they’d get scared even more. They didn’t know he was simply watching soaps via his eye implant.",
		"egypt_tot_info": "Thoth is untouched by general fuss and doesn’t give advice unless asked to. Other Advisors sometimes think that all he cares about is libraries and newsfeeds. There is nothing new in this world for Thoth: he’s seen it all a thousand times, and he knows any incident’s outcome before it even arises.",
		"japan_ryu_info": "Boarding operations are rare in space warfare. Well, unless Ryu or Specter are in charge, that is. Playing with inertia, breaking into lock chambers, the roar of rescue shuttles containing the cowardly fleeing enemies and facing a few of those directly—that’s what makes Ryu truly happy.",
		"japan_spectre_info": "Back in the time when he was 100% human, Specter’s athletic abilities peaked. Defeating everyone who dared face him one on one, he realized that his only undefeated opponent was his very own species’ biology and its certain regrettable limits… that he ended up violating.",
		"japan_mizuki_info": "Pirate warfare resembles roach extermination these days, but just half a century ago you’d see a very different picture: pirate gangs used to seize colony ships and attack their bases. Mizuki survived one raid like that, but her family didn’t, so hunting down pirates has become her sole purpose in life.",
		"japan_yamato_info": "A former soldier, officer, state official, and policeman, Mr. Yamato could easily novelize his adventures, but he’s not vain. Rumor has it, he even served as advisor to one yakuza head in order to repay his son’s debts. Oh, that must be a lie: he’s brought up his kids too well to have them fall into debt traps.",
		"japan_nedda_info": "With space wide-open for humankind to explore, education is still a luxury. Nedda got lucky in this regard, but she hasn’t become a professor or a state official. And each new world that she encounters is an adventure, a new challenge to her expertise.",
		"japan_yuki_info": "You’ll hardly find a better companion for sabotage or subversion than Yuki. His skills in that area are inferior only to his own misanthropy and nihilism, which is why he interacts successfully with vending machines and coffee makers only.",
		"usa_catori_info": "Conversing with Catori is like visiting an ancient temple and a psychotherapist at the same time. Her vis-à-vis becomes filled with knowledge, their aim more precise and their will stronger by far. Even death is negligible when faced with the higher purpose.",
		"usa_ethan_hunt_info": "Lucas likes his missions accompanied. He’s most fond of the Scarabs’ laborious nature and Yuri’s healthy recklessness. He’s put off by Guerrero and Catori: the former is annoying in his strict criticism of objectivism, and the latter he just plain can’t understand.",
		"usa_drake_info": "While he might look like a sweet cozy grandpa, Drake has seen a lot in his day: his brothers-in-arms passed away in his lap, and enemies burned alive with the ships he had torched. He sees war as a sad necessity: some colonists are no better than pirates, and these should certainly be terminated. ",
		"usa_guerrero_info": "For years, Guerrero has been breeding animals adapted to space life. He succeeded greatly with red pandas, who now take both zero gravity and acceleration load as if they were born into them. He hopes to teach them coherent speech by means of further genetic tweaks.",
		"usa_tiberius_info": "Tiberius’s career is a mind-blowing story of success. Chances are, he’ll inspire a movie one day, but it is most likely that the final motion picture won’t feature nonstop calculations, tons of statistical data devoured, and countless hours spent over mathematic models.",
		"usa_ellen_info": "The red cat that was by Ellen’s side during her baptism by fire is now pretty old and worse for wear; and the poor thing hates traveling. So, Ellen teleports to visit him after every successful mission of hers to walk side by side in the parks of one of the few colonies with Earth-like atmosphere. ",
		"russia_jason_info": "Back in his days as a free colonist, Jason realized that certain issues were best resolved outside legal frameworks. When Dark Matter prices go up a tad too much, his failproof move is to show its seller his cargo hold with the seller’s scared and famished relatives inside.",
		"russia_valeria_info": "Roaming from one colony to another since childhood, young Valerie had to trade her practice shuttle for a single-seater fighter jet to defend her then homeland. The cockpit is her home now. To Valerie, living on the ground is the same as folding her wings and surrendering her freedom.",
		"russia_anna_info": "Anna spends all her free time exploring uncharted parts of the Universe in Yuri’s or Bastet’s company. So far, they’ve found plenty of gravitational anomalies, distorted realities, and dark stars. Yet what stokes them most is the chance to find traces of fallen civilizations. Oh, and Bastet believes they’ll be getting lucky any day now.",
		"russia_ivan_info": "Exo is often asked about his shield. Will scraping it with a laser cause an atomic blast? Can you pierce it with a knife? Well, Exo is eager to let the curious see for themselves. The shield is made from the defense mechanisms of a written-off spaceship, but it’s not cost-effective enough for mass production just yet.",
		"russia_yury_info": "Space has no limits. Why fight over it? Surely, there’s enough room for everybody. Yuri is certain that each faction can simply go its own way. History will resolve who was right. And for now, you should just travel as far as your engines let you, learning as much as your mind can process.",
		"pirates_filibuster_info": "Your middle-of-the-road galactic pirate, the Freebooter denies any labor carried out for common good; tends to be psychopathic and sadistic. He aspires after management positions for the associated power and income yet lacks strategic thinking. Bitter and ill-tempered. Might be why he’s not married.",
		"pirates_metal_info": "Many believe Rat Royale to be the most powerful being in the Galaxy. For one thing, Specter’s most coveted dream is to face him in battle. However, Rat Royale always chooses life over reputation. So, by the time defenses are down, he’s already ducking into the emergency shuttle to flee. ",
		"pirates_polymer_info": "If there was a wealth ranking in the Galaxy, Legates would have claimed its lion’s share. Their identities are kept secret, but every now and then enforcement agents stumble upon private space bases with billions on their accounts and tons of Dark Matter in storage. Legal and actual implications for their owners are dire.",
		"pirates_antimatter_info": "While some pirates dream of Coordinators’ power, others wouldn’t accept this promotion in a million years. Luckily, it’s optional. A newly appointed Coordinator becomes a living machine stripped of all former values and connections. Only the light from other worlds can somewhat stir their feelings.",
		"pirates_elite_info": "The Elites are a rare example of tech and faculties of different pirate factions coming together efficiently. The Steel Rats sell the best armor; the Legion supplies weapons; and the Dominion oversees engines. Many colonists mistake them for an easy target, which only keeps the pirates’ inflow of resources steady.",
		"pirates_base_metal_info": "The Steel Rats soldiers kick up bloody fights in their fortresses on the regular, which helps determine the lower, the middle and the top levels of hierarchy, including the potential Rat Royale. The most streetwise of them sell broadcasts of these punch-ups to colonists. Hopefully, galaxy-wide betting will be available one day.",
		"pirates_base_polymer_info": "Combing through Dominion’s bases, one sometimes finds traces of unknown chemical elements. Self-destruction mechanisms leave next to nothing for eager researchers, hence the high value of these finds. This idea keeps going round that the source of these elements must be way beyond our Universe.",
		"pirates_base_antimatter_info": "These bases seem peaceful enough, all clean production facilities and their personnel looking like your average engineer. However, just half a century ago, the Legion used to raid and seize entire solar systems, killing and enslaving their inhabitants. And it is bound to go back to its nasty ways as soon as there’s a solid chance.",
		"buildings_sphere_1_info": "We used to think that one Dyson Sphere could cover all of humanity’s energy needs. As time goes by, it is increasingly clear that there’s no such thing as \"enough energy\". Replace your oil, gas, coal, or uranium with the Sphere—and you’ll immediately find a thousand other ways to use it.",
		"buildings_sphere_2_info": "Human health can be improved endlessly, just as the age of youth can be extended. It does require a ton of chemicals, hours of therapy, tissue cloning, etc.… And it all boils down to energy for devices, farms, and robot assemblers. Therefore, it won’t hurt to increase our sphere’s efficiency.",
		"buildings_sphere_3_info": "We’ve corrected the human body’s points of weakness. In fact, we’ve bettered it overall. (While there’s no cap on perfection, of course.) Yet we need more space. Not even to live as such but to simply satisfy our growing curiosity. Everyone wants to roam the Galaxy, teleport all over the place and build bases. We need more energy, yes.",
		"buildings_sphere_4_info": "Ah, interstellar fleets. Thousands of inhabited worlds. Automated factories, teleports for spaceships and personnel, defenses shored up in space… Oh, and don’t forget virtual worlds, artificial intelligence, and multilayer simulations in research centers. We’ve got it all. Nice.",
		"buildings_sphere_5_info": "With the Kemetians’ help, we can bring our technologies to unfathomable heights. Yet there is, in fact, a threshold we shouldn’t cross, as grabbing too much star energy will cause damage to nearby planets. Okay, so we need more spheres. And more stars. All of them, preferably.",
		"buildings_outpost_info": "An Outpost is good fun for the less developed species. Just think about it: you occupy a star and use some of its energy solely for the purpose of not letting others do it… Not exactly worthy of a third-generation civilization, now is it?",
		"buildings_support_1_info": "The only clear shortcoming of a Support Facility is the lack of decent weaponry; however, its passive defense systems can give all the humanity’s engineers a real good run for their money. The common belief has it that these facilities are the peak of pirate engineering genius. ",
		"buildings_support_2_info": "Kemet’s scientists have their doubts about whether pirates were indeed the original designers of Support Facilities. They must have supplied labor and materials, but the constructions and the engineering solutions are certainly way too advanced for the pirates’ limited scientific base.",
		"buildings_support_3_info": "It could be that Support Facilities were conceived by the very same mystery forces the Star Dominion works for. Opponents of this idea insist that, if it were the case, all of Dominion’s bases would have been way more hi-tech and dangerous. Well, and what if the facilities were simply an experimental try-out…?",
		"buildings_support_4_info": "Some tend to think that Support Facilities are the relics of a more developed civilization of the past. Yet carbon dating indicates they are all quite recent constructions. Attempts to copy any of their technologies have failed miserably so far, but hope still fuels further research.",
		"buildings_support_5_info": "Why do Support Facilities located closer to the center of the Galaxy demonstrate higher efficiency? Well, could be that they are powered by gravity. Their powerplants have occupied the minds of human and Kemet scientists for long now. Ah, we’ll figure it out eventually!",
		"pirates_symbol_metal_info": "Wild; unharnessed; chthonic. If it weren’t for missiles, bullets, and lasers, that's the force that would dominate the Universe. And yet, a long time ago, the once mighty lizards conceded to tiny mammals, for pure force means little without intelligence and adaptivity. Now, the Rats will either come to terms with it or—become history.",
		"pirates_symbol_polymer_info": "The Legion takes pride in its highly regulated order: strict hierarchy and a cult of power, solidarism and the constant fight against external enemies—the legionaries believe that future is theirs. Kemet scientists, however, insist that the Legion is already a thing of the past. There'll be no place for it in the world when humanity takes its next step forward.",
		"pirates_symbol_antimatter_info": "Neither Kemet, nor Terra Unita have ever seized a live Coordinator. All we get is ruins of their bases and strongholds, which sometimes give us enough to replicate some of their tech. Said tech is always strange and has no close analogs. It's almost as if it's not a product of R&D but a direct handover from some unknown power.",
		"egypt_helmet_info": "When Kemet’s representatives first met with the human race, they were filled with both hopes and doubts about our race. It took us thousands of years to become worthy of the next encounter, and we really shouldn’t blow it this time.",
		"egypt_chest_info": "It is still a complete mystery to us why people of Earth resemble the Kemetians so much. Our big brothers are very elusive about certain things, and there’s no making them spill the beans.",
		"egypt_gloves_info": "During their visits to Earth in eras long gone, Kemetians nearly never interfered in humanity’s progress, letting humans find and walk their own way. Despite the popular—and naïve—myth, they had never even come close to the pyramids, let alone got involved in their construction.",
		"egypt_ring_info": "A symbol of vengeance and justice, this ring is named after the fairest and the most just of all dwellers of Kemet, who had chanced upon Earth back in the very ancient times during her travels.",
		"egypt_weapon_info": "There are some wild speculations about the Kemetians’ home planet, but no man has ever visited it. Some believe that cosmic deities own hundreds of worlds, while others expect them to be nomads: after all, they can make themselves feel at home just about anywhere thanks to their science.",
		"usa_helmet_info": "There are systems that evolve perfectly in the state of quiet and calm. Now, other systems require constant and explosive growth, otherwise they start devouring themselves or choke on their own existence. While growth is a challenge for some, it is a vital necessity for others.",
		"usa_chest_info": "Many generations used to envy their predecessors who had the luck and honor of discovering new lands and building the new society on Earth. As space-wide colonization began, humanity produced yet another generation of pilgrims, who now set their solar sails over hi-tech ships of steel.",
		"usa_gloves_info": "There’s room in space for cowboys, and marksmen, and prospectors. A year is enough here to create a giant corporation and make enough money to provide for your family’s lifetime, greatgrandkids included. Anyone can make their dream happen: this is the New World’s creed.",
		"usa_cape_info": "Freedom of space is wonderful, but everyone in the New World knows: there are truths and values that uphold in any era. Those who go against them end up going against the very nature of man, and they should be dealt with. Order and freedom are not antipodes but merely two faces of the same medal.",
		"usa_shield_info": "Some find the New World to be full of fortune-seekers and freethinkers, while others see them as reactionaries stuck in the past. With some feeling that the New World imposes its will on everyone else, others think they are nothing but a bunch of egoists. Balance of contradictions is what this stellar nation’s power is rooted in.",
		"russia_helmet_info": "Terra Unita is a union of many states and corporations that have willingly and strategically become one in order to put visionary ideas into practice. Their ultimate goal is the progress of humanity, the full manifestation of its potential, and the overcoming of limits imposed by humans’ own biology.",
		"russia_chest_gold_info": "Humanity has tried many times to rid society of injustices and economic shortcomings. In certain cases, incremental progress was just enough for that, but sometimes a quantum leap ahead was needed. Not all of those attempts were successful, but each in its own way laid the foundation for future triumph. ",
		"russia_gloves_gold_info": "Humans have made mistakes many times throughout their existence. Time after time, they’d lose the fruits of their progress, reverting to primitive and cruel systems of the past. It took some truly colossal effort and continuous and unanimous self-education and development to break out from this vicious circle.",
		"russia_pipboy_info": "Terra Unita currently controls multiple planets, stars, and manned space stations. And their number is growing nonstop thanks to committed effort. Yes: terraforming and scientific research are the two key occupations for most Terrans.",
		"russia_gloves_green_info": "Upon reaching adulthood, each man sets out on a journey, more often as part of a group than alone. It allows humanity to explore new areas of space with incredible speed, as well as demonstrates earthlings the importance of responsibility, education, and labor.",
		"japan_helmet_info": "The Empire rose from the ashes when others were certain it was just a shadow, just half-erased traces of its past. Its former weaknesses became its strengths and its shackles its weapons, with false benefactors rejected. The mirk of space washes away past shame and defeats, allowing for new life and narrative.",
		"japan_chest_info": "Many on Earth have tried taking the same path, but they never understood which tradition to honor and which to discard. They dragged their dusty biases and rundown myths to space with them. However, cosmos is unforgiving to those whose conscience denies novelty.",
		"japan_gloves_info": "In the endless vastness of space, the Empire managed to spread its wings. The shackles of the old world order no longer weighed it down. Acquiring planets and technologies greedily, the Empire was not afraid of looking for new forms and ideas. One principle has remained key: the honor of your own people is above all else, including profits or personal fame.",
		"japan_cape_info": "Nowadays, the size and the authority of the Mountain Empire exceed even the most ambitious dreams of its patriots from the past. It controls hundreds of solar systems and has fully terraformed several planets. Many of the Empire’s heirs have become knight-errants, roaming the Galaxy and bringing the Empire’s culture to the worlds of free colonists.",
		"japan_weapon_info": "Weapons produced by the Mountain Empire have always been renowned for their excellent quality, whatever the name of the Empire at any given period of its history. Earnest attitude to work is the principle that has never failed its people.",
		"russia_chest_green_info": "Doesn’t matter if you’re fighting pirates, building spaceships, or managing factory robots. What matters is doing your job well and honorably. After all, your job is a more than accurate reflection of your personality.",
		"офисный стафф для Египта": "Space can be conquered by missiles and bombs, but it can also submit to wisdom and prudence. There’s a solution to every issue; and while there are no bad solutions, there are certainly some lesser suitable and clearly inefficient ones.",
		"офисный стафф для США": "Man is the measure of all things, and each of us is of the utmost value to our own selves. Hence the healthy egoism that must always feature in any action we take, even if just a bit. You and you only can build your own future.",
